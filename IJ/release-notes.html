<li> <u>1.50h 13 March 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Ajay Sood, the ROI Manager's "OR (Combine)" command now
uses a progress bar and runs on a separate thread.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, the Converter class, which mplements the commands
in the <i>Image&gt;Type</i> submenu, now displays a messaged in the "Log"
window if the image is locked. This error is typically caused by plugins that
call IJ.run() methods and mistakenly implement the PlugInFilter interface.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the <i>Window&gt;Tile</i> command
displays an errow message if there is an unfrozen plot window open. Use
the <i>More&gt;&gt;Freeze Plot</i> command or PlotWindow.freeze(true) method
to freeze a plot wondow.
<li> The size shown in the <i>Window</i> menu is updated when
an image is converted to a different type.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the Dialog.addNumber("Prompt:",NaN)
function now creates a blank field instead of showing "NaN".
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the Plot.setBackgroundColor() 
macro function (PlotBackgroundColorDemo.txt).
<li> Added the ij.plugin.ImageInfo class as a replacement for ij.plugin.filter.info.
<li> Thanks to Jeff Hanson, fixed a bug that caused the showMessage()
macro function to work with the &lt;html&gt; tag but not with &lt;HTML&gt;.
<li> Thanks to Arttu Miettinen, fixed a bug that could cause image corruption
if the slice selector scrollbar was used while a stack operation was being performed.
<li> Thanks to Ryota Homma, fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager's
<i>More&gt;Remove Positions</i> command to fail.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Rename</i> command to sometimes not
correctly update the <i>Window</i> menu.
<li> Thanks to Herbie Gluender, fixed a v1.50f regression that caused the
<i>Process&gt;FFT&gt;Swap Quadrants</i> command to disappear.
<li> Thanks to S. Rothery, fixed a 1.50f regression that caused the
<i>Multi Measure</i> command in the ROI Manager to not work correctly
with hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Mark Hiner, fixed a 1.50d regression that caused
the multi-point tool to not correctly place points on zoomed images.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a 1.50g regression that caused
macros that used the run("Copy") function on images with overlays to
not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Ryota Homma, fixed a 1.49i regression that caused
selection subtraction by drawing with the alt key down to not
work reliably.
